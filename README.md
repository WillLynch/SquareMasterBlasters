# Square Master Blasters
Square Master Blasters is a fun turn-based game, which enhances the game play of chess. The rules are simple -
each character contains special move, health point, range, and attack abilities. Each player gets 2 moves each turn,
which could be a move, or an attack. In the future, barriers will be implemented, as well as the facility to choose
ones set of characters.
