# SENG330
SENG 330 Group 10 Project Repository. Turn-based 2-player game - name to be chosen.

Setup:
------

We will be using Python 2.7, and Kivy 1.9.0. Follow download/setup instructions at http://kivy.org/#download.
Make sure you have the proper versions.

I have personally chosen to develop on Linux, and use virtualenv to create an isolated environment for this
specific project. You can read about virtualenv here: http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/.
But virtualenv is not necessary, and i'm sure you will be able to get it running on Windows/Mac, as Kivy is
intended to be cross-platform.

Once you have cloned this project and have Kivy installed, try running Game.py with the Python interpreter.
You should see a window pop-up with a big button that says 'Hello World'. Let me know if you have any issues.
